# Quick ipython notebooks

The description below is more like a reminder note to myself.

## What is it about?

Repo of some personal notes about things I face myself on the way out my Scientific and Python journeys. Mainly interesting things related to some personal research, others for pure fun. Never related to my job (just saying).

## Anyone can use it?

Well, if there is something you get interested, go ahead. Propably you could find better stuff around.

Just in case, I appended a MIT license, but don't care about it, just formality.

## How to use it?

The notes will be separated in directories. Instructions about how to configure and what packages are required to run within the ipynb are intended to be provided in each dir case.
