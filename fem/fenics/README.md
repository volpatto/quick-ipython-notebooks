# FEniCS Examples

Here I provide some [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) introductory example that I consider useful. I developed all the example within a [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) environment. To construct one same as the one I have, you can use the environment.yml file provided in the present directory.

## Available examples

* 1D Poisson Problem
* 1D Advection-Diffusion Problem
    - Classical Galerkin approximation
    - SUPG stabilization
    - GLS stabilization
* 1D Reaction-Diffusion Problem
    - Classical Galerkin approximation
    - GGLS stabilization
